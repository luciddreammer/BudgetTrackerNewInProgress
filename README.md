<h1>Budget Tracker</h1>

<h2>Current project that I'm working on, It will be created using ASP.NET Core and React</h2>
Budget Tracker will be web application to simplify money management!

User would be able to:

- Add categories and sub-categories
- Add transactions
- Set budget for each month/year
- Add informations about earnings, and planned transactions
- Manage every added transaction and category
- View all transactions filtered by categories, dates, ammounts, and more
- See yearly and monthly summary

Right now I'm in progress of learning needed technologies for this:

Fetching data with JS

React Forms, States and Props

.NET Authorization and Authentication of user, transfering data

SQL management
